= Setup Script for RHEL-based Distros =

== Introduction ==

A setup script for Red Hat-based distros I use for my servers. Script assumes a minimal install. Compatible with 5.x and 6.x releases

Please edit the first few lines of the script to configure some options. 

== Defaults ==

* Timezone is set to GMT
* IPV6 is disabled
* Root email is sent to admin@(your hostname)
* SSH
** Root login is disabled
** Port is set to 9853

== External Repositories ==

The script installs and uses these repositories ''selectively''. For example, IUS is only ever used for PHP 5.4+ and MySQL 5.5+. They are all disabled (i.e., <code>enabled=0</code>) after they're installed.

Disabled for now. I'm sure it's awesome. [https://github.com/nmoureyii/centos-setup This project] seems like a good starting point.
