= Setup Script for RHEL-based Distros =

== Introduction ==

A quick setup script for Red Hat-based distros I use for my servers. Compatible with 5.x and 6.x releases. Script assumes a base/minimal vanilla install. 

Please edit the first few lines of the script to configure some options. If <code>INSTALL_BASIC_ONLY</code> is set to "yes", the script sets up

* Quite a few useful tools, languages, libraries, and services
* Some external repositories, which are disabled (i.e., <code>enabled=0</code>)

Set <code>INSTALL_BASIC_ONLY</code> to "no" to install a LAMP stack, Nginx, and MongoDB.

== Defaults ==

* Timezone is set to GMT; you'll want to change this
* IPV6 is disabled
* Root email is sent to admin@(server hostname)
* For SSH:
** Root login is disabled
** Port is set to 9853
* NTP uses a few servers [http://infohost.nmt.edu/~armiller/timeserv.htm off this page]. 

== External Repositories ==

The script installs and uses many external repositories ''selectively''. For example, IUS is only ever used for PHP 5.4+ and MySQL 5.5+. They are all disabled (i.e., <code>enabled=0</code>) after they're installed.

Disabled for now. I'm sure it's awesome. [https://github.com/nmoureyii/centos-setup This project] seems like a good starting point.
